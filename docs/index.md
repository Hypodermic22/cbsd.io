# Welcome to CBSD

CBSD is a management layer written for the FreeBSD jail(8) subsystem, bhyve and Xen. The project is positioned as a single integrated tool of comprehensive solution for building and deploying virtual environments quickly with pre-defined software sets with minimal configuration.

No extra OS functionality has been exposed yet, and everything that CBSD can do, you could also run manually with tens or hundreds of commands in the CLI using the underlying utilities (Not that you would want to!)

<i>If you're tired of manually typing hundreds of commands just to organize a virtual system? May we recommend CBSD instead</i>

CBSD is a software project intended as a management layer for the FreeBSD Jail subsystem, written to utilize jail(8), bhyve and Xen. 
The project idea is to offer a single integrated tool for building and deploying virtual environments quickly, with pre-defined software sets and minimal configuration. The project doesn't alter the OS in any way, instead it offers automation and speeds up deployment.
